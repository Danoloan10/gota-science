SARS-CoV-2 is a virus of the _Coronaviridae_ family. The virions of this family are characterised for presenting a crown-like surface and present protrusions, S (spike) proteins, of a length around 20 nm. These length is observable with SEM & TEM microscopes (see [Optical fundamentals](optical-fundamentals.md)). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 virion is spherical, with a diameter of around 50â€“200 nm, which simplifies its visualisation due to its spherical symmetry, rendering rotations of the virion redundant for identification.

These special characteristics can allow the visual discrimination of virions of this family, given that their prevalence is low enough among humans and heavily subjected to its seasonality, which is the case. This visual discrimination can be cumbersome for a human observer, but with the aid of Computer Vision the time to detect the virus in a sample can be reduced dramatically, while preserving great or achieving even greater accuracy.

To validate the effectiveness of this method we must assess the prevalence of the virus of interest (SARS-CoV-2) against others of the _Coronaviridae_ family in humans - for this, see [Epidemiological fundamentals](epidemiological-fundamentals.md).
