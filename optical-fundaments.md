# Optical fundaments

Based on the characteristics of the virion, the acquisition of image samples requires a resolution of aproximately 20nm minimum to be able to appreciate the relief of the capsid. Given that this relief is the discriminating property of the virus, the ability to distinguish it is critical. For this several options are proposed:

## Transmission Electronic Microscopes

The use of Transmission Electronic Microscopes (TEM) is mainly recommended, as they have a widely sufficient resolution for this application. This method has already been used fo diagnosis previously - however, it has been displaced by other methods of analisys, as ELISA or PCR, partly because of the needs of operation and the reliance on human interpretation of TEM analysis.  

Nevertheless, the advantage TEM presents is its disponibility, speed, sensibility and lower reliance of preparation of samples, thus accelerating the acquisition process [1]. This method is considered highly compatible with the main purpose also because of two reasons:
1. Having as an objective the identification of the presence of a single element (with a fixed and known size) in a homogeneous sample.
2. Aiding the process with computational methods can automate it so that there is no reliance on human interpretation, and so being able to reach faster timings.

## Alteranative methods
It is valued the use of other techniques, mainly projection based, with wave types that allow a sufficient resolution.
