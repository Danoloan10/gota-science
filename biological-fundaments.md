SARS-CoV-2 is a virus of the Coronaviridae family. The particles of this family are caracterised for presenting a crown-like shape on their surface (S (spike) proteins), and present protrusions of a length around 20 nm - lengths observable with SEM & TEM microscopes (see optical-fundaments). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 virion is of spherical shape, with a diameter of around 50â€“200 nm, which simplifies its visualisation due to its spherical symmetry.

These special characteristics can allow the visual discrimination of virions of this family, given that their prevalence is low enough among humans and heavily subjected to its seasonality, which is the case. This visual discrimination can be cumbersome for a human analyst, but with the aid of Computer Vision the time to detect the virus in a sample can be reduced dramatically, while preserving great accuracy.

However, to balance the effectiveness of this method we need know the prevalence of the virus of interest (SARS-CoV-2) against others of the Coronaviridae family in humans - for this, see epidemiological-fundaments.
