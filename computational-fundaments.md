# Computational fundaments

Computer vision has seen great advances in the last years. Where results delayed 15 days, now they can be obtained in less than 15 minutes. The key points for this enhancement are:

* A great size of sample data
* Homogeneity and correct classification of the data
* Modern AI algorithms

Computer vision for clinical use has been studied and implemented with satisfactory results [1]. Although much progress is to be made, the technical advantages of this proposal are:

* The great number of infected people can provide the AI with enough training data to achieve high precision
* The "crown-like shape" of the target virus is similar and differentiated
* Machine learning has proven effetive in clinical medicine [1].
