# Optical basis

Based on the characteristics of the virion, the acquisition of image samples requires a resolution of at least 10nm to be able to determine the surface of the capsid. Given that these surface characteristics are the discriminating properties of the virus, the ability to distinguish them is critical. Several imaging techniques are proposed for this purpose:

## Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM)

The use of Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM) is highly recommended, as they have a widely sufficient resolution for this application. This method has already been used fo diagnosis previously - however, it has been displaced by other methods of analisys, as ELISA or PCR, partly because of the needs of operation and the reliance on human interpretation of TEM analysis.  

Nevertheless, the advantage TEM presents is its disponibility, speed, sensibility and lower reliance of preparation of samples, thus accelerating the acquisition process [1]. This method is considered highly compatible with the main characteristics of the test because of two reasons:
1. Having as an objective the identification of the presence of a single element (with a fixed and known size) in an homogeneous sample.
2. The human observer bottleneck which limits TEM diagnosis can be eliminated by the aid of computational methods to achieve automation, so that there is no reliance on human interpretation. This enables fast diagnosis.

## Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM)

Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) pose a good alternative to TEM due to their higher availability in research facilities, cost and ease of use. For these reasons, SEM has been chosen and successfully implemented in many systems requiring particle examination for quality control purposes. 

These applications can be translated for the field of virology [2] because, even though its resolution is less than that of TEM, it is still largely sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the test, and is in fact made even more likely to succeed due to the reliance on computational diagnosis, as opposed to a human observer which may not be as adept in identifying the common patterns in this imaging system.
