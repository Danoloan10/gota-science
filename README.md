# GOTA

GOTA (diaGnóstico Óptico-morfomaTemático Automático) is a computer-aided fast optical testing method for COVID-19. For more information see [our DevPost page](https://devpost.com/software/gota).

## About the project

This project is aimed to propose a solution for fast testing of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Due to its technical characteristics, this test is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather a diferential diagnostic test. This test is summarized in three procedures:

* Retreiving and processing of the virus sample
* Acquisition of images of the sample
* Automatic processing of the images to obtain a diagnosis

The setup needed for the retreival of the samples will require staff familiarized with the equipment, but will be highly replicable and reduce costs and time required to obtain a diagnosis.
