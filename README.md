# GOTA

GOTA (diaGnostic Optical-morphomaThematic Automation) is a computer-aided fast optical testing method for COVID-19. For more information see [our DevPost page](https://devpost.com/software/gota).

## About the project

This project aims to propose a solution for fast testing of COVID-19 by the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Due to its technical characteristics, this test it does not provide a definitive, 100% specific diagnosis, but rather a differential diagnostic assessment. This test can be summarised in three procedures:

* Retrieval and treatment of the viral sample
* Image acquisition of the sample
* Automatic processing of the images to determine diagnosis

The setup needed for the retreival of the samples will require staff familiarised with the equipment, but will be highly replicable and reduce costs and the time required to obtain a diagnosis, which can be optimised to take 20 min from sample collection to diagnosis.
